Context
Women roughly occupy half of the world's population but when it comes to the total workforce of a country, the percentage of male and female workers are rarely similar. This is even more prominent for the developing and underdeveloped countries. While several reasons such as the insufficient access to education, religious superstitions, lack of adequate infrastrucutres are responsible for this discrepancy, it goes way beyond these. One significant factor is the fertility rate of women which is a count for the total number of births per an individual woman. And to show its effects on the participation of women in the total workforce, percentage of female workers in the labor force has been considered. Using simple linear regression model, the relationship between these two factors can be analyzed.

Content
The datasets span over 23 years (from 1995 to 2017). Data has been collected separately from two surveys carried out by the World Bank for both the fertility rate and the percentage of female in the total workforce of Bangladesh. These two datasets were compiled into one dataset and it corresponds to the 23 data points for these two variables ("fertility rate" and "worker percent").

Inspiration
Linear model as well as other statistical methods can be applied on this dataset to analyze if there is any viable relationship between these two variables.
